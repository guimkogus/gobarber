# GoBarber

## ðŸ¤” About the project

### What?
This project was created together with the GoStack 8.0 of <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br"> Rocketseat </a> taught by Diego Fernandes. The classes aim to create the first portfolios, introducing and teaching tecnologies like Node.js, ReactJS and React Native, as well as other libraries and resources.

### Why?
What motivated me to participate and create the project was to build a portfolio and acquire new knowledge. I will be very happy if you can send any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything else that you have noticed that can make me a better developer!

### The big idea
_"Find a barber wherever you're at, whenever you want"._

### Project State
The project still's in development state. Right now I feel like the __API__ is in a good state of development and I'll start to work on the front-end __Web__ with ReactJS. The __Mobile__ version will be developed as soon as I finish the web label.
